# Vue Blocks
It's hard to find a configurable, extensible page block editor. Vue blocks is a vuex driven page creator using Bootstrap 4.

It's seriously work in progress, please don't expect it to work 100%.

Plan is:
* base element blocks
* base form blocks
* page settings
* robust save, cancel, undo
* firebase integration for storage
* firebase integration for auth
* vue router driven from firebase
